# Looking for new maintainers
I won't add new features or fixes due to complicated technical debt reasons since this project was created with little to zero knowledge and I won't interest in this project. Rewritting this project would take a lot of time. If you wish to maintain further, please contact me from my profile or open new issue with **valid reason**. This project will become archived in approximative 2 years from now until someone becomes new maintainer of this project.

There's no new precompiled build yet, so the only option is to build it yourself.<br><br>

You need to clone this repository, then go to the folder, open in terminal and use `npm i --save`. Finally, run `./run.bat` if you're using Windows, otherwise `run.sh`.<br>
Alternatively, use `npm run build` to build a binary version (make sure to have `electron-packager` installed locally)

# Known issues
## Some buttons in "More" context menu doesn't work!
Still working in progress.

## (node:17625) electron: Failed to load URL: ... ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
It's not an issue because the adblock plugin is doing its job to block tracking/ad urls. Disable it in Settings if you want to ditch.
